# Books-MERN-Stack

## Description

This application was to take source code from being a RESTful application and convert that to a MERN stack application by implementing GraphQL. This taught me a good amount of information about different npm packages that could be implemented and challenges you may face with deprecations. Overall, I learned a great deal in documentation dives to find syntactical differences between technologies.

***Please Note*** Having difficulties with login functionality. Working on a fix.
